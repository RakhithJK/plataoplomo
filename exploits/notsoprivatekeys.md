# Not-So-PrivateKeys

Many times in information security, people are the biggest risk.  
This time I discovered that Apple forgot to remove factory RSA private keys for firmware personalization (IMG4 ticket and baseband).  
One of Apple's private frameworks on the mac used for managing mobile devices (MobileDevice.framework) contained these private keys in the strings section of the binary.  
Eventhough the keys seem to be meant for developer devices internally used by Apple I believe the private keys used for the baseband could perhaps work on production devices too.  
I publish this as a manifest for fellow reverse engineers as an encouragement for them to follow my footsteps in reverse engineering more frameworks to document the unknown.  
If by any chance this respository will be taken down unlawfully under the enforcement of the DMCA then I would find that at the very least a very cowardly move.  
My time at GitHub is shortly coming to an end anyway as I find the current terms and service GitHub offers me not in accordance with my strive to freedom.  
Therefore if this repository will be taken down, then so will my GitHub account.  
I'll pursuit my journey elsewhere, never forget that onions are always the most important item on a shopping list.  

## Fantastic keys and where to find them
I've written python scripts for dumping all RSA private keys, certificates (and public keys if any) from binary files.  
I've been lazily coding these scripts, because I found these RSA keys by accident and need to focus on other research.  
By default if you run the scripts on a mac without providing arguments it will dump all secrets from the MobileDevice framework to your current directory.  
If you happen to be familliar with radare2 and have a script-kiddies understanding of where to look for the strings in a binary then you can even find out what key/cert is used for what firmware.  

## Future research
I will not be attempting anything with these keys for now as I have tons of important projects going on and just don't find the time for it.  
However, if you're smart and know how to personalize firmware and perhaps have played around with img4tool from Tihmstar then you might be lucky and can take this further.  
Let me know when the keys have been useful to you ;)
